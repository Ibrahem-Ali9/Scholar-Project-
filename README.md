# EduHub

EduHub is an all-in-one Learning Management System (LMS) that connects students, teachers, and parents on a single platform, making course management, student progress tracking, and assessment management simpler and more interactive. EduHub's unique focus on real-time interactions and continuous parent engagement aims to enhance educational experiences and foster better collaboration within educational communities.

## Project Vision

EduHub envisions becoming the foremost unified educational platform that enables real-time, interactive learning and collaboration among students, teachers, and parents. Unlike traditional LMS platforms, EduHub places emphasis on robust parent engagement and live, real-time interactions, filling the gaps left by many existing platforms.

## Features

- **Course Management**: Simplified management of course content, assignments, and quizzes.
- **Progress Tracking**: Continuous tracking of student performance, accessible by both teachers and parents.
- **Assessment Management**: Teachers can create, assign, and review assessments efficiently.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant updates for students, teachers, and parents using OneSignal.
- **Live Sessions**: Embedded Google Meet/Zoom for in-system live classes.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Custom access permissions based on user roles (students, teachers, parents).

## Technical Overview

EduHub is developed with a robust tech stack designed for scalability and responsiveness.

### Tech Stack

- **Back-End**: Flask (RESTful API)
- **Front-End**: React (responsive and interactive UI)
- **Database**: MySQL (managing structured data)
- **Notifications**: OneSignal (real-time push notifications)
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **API Development & Testing**: Postman
  
## Project Architecture

EduHub employs a three-tier architecture comprising a front-end, back-end, and database layer. The platform will integrate third-party APIs for live sessions and implement caching strategies for optimal data retrieval and load balancing.

### Key Tools

- **Flask**: Handles server-side operations.
- **React**: Builds a responsive front-end user interface.
- **MySQL**: Manages structured data storage for course materials, progress tracking, and session details.
- **OneSignal**: Delivers reliable, real-time notifications.
- **GitHub**: Supports version control and collaborative development.
- **Postman**: Facilitates API development and testing.
- **Google Meet/Zoom**: Embeds live sessions within the EduHub platform.

## Project Team

We are a team of five developers working collaboratively to bring EduHub to life, using Scrum methodology to ensure iterative development and continual improvement.
